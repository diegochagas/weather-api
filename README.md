# Weather API

Test with React and Redux using a Weather API to show a list of citys and their climes.

The city code that was used in this api is Auckland in New Zealand. You can find the list of all city codes in the documentation of the api.

The Weather API are available on https://openweathermap.org/ .

The Google Maps was also used to show the location of the cities. (Not working with React Hooks yet)
